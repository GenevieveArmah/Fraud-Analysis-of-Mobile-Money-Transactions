# Fraud-Analysis-of-Mobile-Money-Transactions
This is a Power BI dashboard focused on fraud analysis of mobile money transactions, providing a comprehensive view of transaction patterns, fraud detection metrics, and customer behavior analysis. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and transaction metrics through charts and visualizations.

The goal is to help stakeholders such as financial analysts, compliance officers, and fraud prevention teams with actionable insights for mitigating fraud risks and improving transaction security.

DASHBOARD COMPONENTS:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):


Total Number of Customers (6.36M)
Total Amount of Transactions (1.14T)
Total Fraudulent Transactions (8,213K)
Average Simulation Hours (243.40)


Transaction Analysis Visualizations:

Bar chart showing total amount by transaction type (Transfer, Cash Out, Cash In, Payment, Debit)
Donut chart comparing total balances before (5.31T) and after (5.44T) transactions


Fraud Pattern Analysis:

Combined bar and line chart showing fraudulent transactions and percentage of customers by transaction type
Horizontal bar chart displaying simulation hours across different transaction types


Transaction Type Breakdown:

Monitored five main transaction categories: Transfer, Cash Out, Cash In, Payment, and Debit
Highest transaction volumes in Transfer (485.29bn) and Cash Out (394.41bn)

INSIGHTS:

While the fraudulent transactions represent a small fraction of the total, their occurrence is significant enough to warrant continuous monitoring and preventive measures.

The dominance of Transfer and Cash Out transactions makes them likely targets for fraudulent activities. These transaction types should be prioritized in fraud detection mechanisms.

The high percentage of fraudulent transactions in Cash Out and Transfer categories underscores the need for enhanced monitoring and stricter security measures for these transaction types.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Strengthen Fraud Detection for High-Risk Transaction Types: Focus on Cash Out and Transfer transactions, as they contribute to the majority of fraudulent cases. Introduce AI-powered anomaly detection systems to identify suspicious activity in real time.

Enhance Customer Awareness: regular educational campaigns to inform customers about fraud prevention techniques and warning signs of fraudulent schemes.

Policy Development and Compliance:Implement stricter verification protocols, especially for large Cash Out and Transfer transactions.

Continuous Monitoring and Reporting:Expand the simulation hours for Cash In transactions, which also exhibit a notable percentage of fraud.
Integrate predictive modeling tools to proactively identify potential fraud before it occurs.
